   THEIR CHOICE, KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY, AND FOR THEIR MUTUAL BENEFIT,

   This Agreement may not be assigned by either party in whole or in part
   without the written consent of the other party which shall not be
   unreasonably withheld, except pursuant to a transfer of all or
   substantially all of Customer's business and assets, whether by merger of

   or construed to create an association, agency, joint venture or
   partnership between the parties or to impose any liability attributable to
   such a relationship upon either Party.

     6. Miscellaneous.

   Any breach of the provisions pertaining to Proprietary Information
   hereinabove will cause irreparable harm to Contractor for which damages
   would not be an adequate remedy, and, therefore, Contractor will be
   entitled to injunctive relief with respect thereto in addition to any
   other remedies. [62][Author ID1: at Tue Feb 12 11:45:00 2002 ]The failure
   of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for
   any period shall not be construed as a waiver of such rights. No changes
   or modifications or waivers to this Agreement will be effective unless in
   writing and signed by an authorised signatory of [63][Author ID1: at Tue
   Feb 12 11:45:00 2002 ]both parties. In the event that any provision of
   this Agreement shall be determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that
   provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so
   that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and
   enforceable. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
   accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the
   conflicts of laws provisions thereof. In any action or proceeding to
   enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled
   to recover costs and attorneys fees. [64][Author ID1: at Tue Feb 12

   herein or delivered pursuant hereto, contains the entire agreement and
   understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter. This
