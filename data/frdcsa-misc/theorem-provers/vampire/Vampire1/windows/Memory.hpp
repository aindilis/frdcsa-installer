//  Memory handling for small and other structures
//  For small structures the memory handling is optimized
//
//  In the debug mode 
//    (1) can keep track of the amount of local and global memory allocated
//    (2) provides functions to check validity of a small memory piece
//    (3) halts on the deallocated of memory that was not allocated or
//        is deallocated
//    (4) can print all allocated but not deallocated structures (memory leak)
