;;      SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology)
;; ================================================

;; This is the source file for the SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology), 
;; an ontology that was developed within the SUO Working Group by merging the
;; various SUO content sources.  The basis for the merge is John Sowa's upper 
;; ontology (as described at http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/toplevel.htm 
;; and in Chapter 2 of his book _Knowledge Representation_, Brooks/Cole, 2000).  
;; The definitions and axioms of the other SUO sources have been aligned with 
;; this ontology.  

;; In addition to Sowa's ontology, the merge incorporates Russell and Norvig's 
;; ontology, PSL (Process Specification Language), Casati and Varzi's theory of 
;; holes, Allen's temporal axioms, the relatively noncontroversial elements of 
;; Smith's and Guarino's respective mereotopologies, the KIF formalization of the 
;; CPR (Core Plan Representation), the ontologies available on the Ontolingua 
;; server maintained by Stanford University's Knowledge Systems Laboratory, the 
;; ontologies developed by ITBM-CNR, some of the verb classes from the second 
;; part of Beth Levin's book "English Verb Classes and Alternations:  A 
;; Preliminary Investigation", some of the spatial relations from an unpublished 
;; paper by Iris Tommelein and Anil Gupta entitled "Conceptual Structures for 
;; Spatial Reasoning", and a "Structural Ontology" proposed by David Whitten and 
;; substantially revised and extended by Chris Menzel.

;; The SUMO is a modular ontology.  That is, the ontology is divided into 
;; self-contained subontologies.  Each subontology is indicated by a section 
;; header, and the dependencies between the subontologies are specified with 
;; statements of the form ";; INCLUDES '<SUBONTOLOGY>'".  These statements are 
;; found at the beginning of each section.  The dependencies between the 
;; various subontologies can also be graphed informally as follows:

&%RelationExtendedToQuantities is a &%Relation that, when it is true on 
a sequence of arguments that are &%RealNumbers, it is also true on a 
sequence of &%ConstantQuantites with those magnitudes in some unit of

(lessThan ?QUANTITY1 ?QUANTITY2) if and only if, for some ?NUMBER1,

(documentation Set "A &%Class that satisfies extensionality as well as

as `built up' from some initial stock of objects by means of certain
constructive operations (such as the pairing or power set operations).
Note that extensionality alone is not sufficient for identifying 
&%Classes with &%Sets, since some &%Classes (e.g. &%Entity) cannot be 
assumed to be &%Sets without contradiction.")

(subclass Proposition Abstract)
(documentation Proposition "&%Propositions are &%Abstract entities that 
express a complete thought or a set of such thoughts.  As an example, 
the formula '(instance Yojo Cat)' expresses the &%Proposition that the 
entity named Yojo is an element of the &%Class of Cats.  Note that 
propositions are not restricted to the content expressed by individual 
sentences of a &%Language.  They may encompass the content expressed by 
theories, books, and even whole libraries.  It is important to distinguish 
&%Propositions from the &%ContentBearingObjects that express them.  A 
&%Proposition is a piece of information, e.g. that the cat is on the mat, 
but a &%ContentBearingObject is an &%Object that represents this information.  
A &%Proposition is an abstraction that may have multiple representations: 
strings, sounds, icons, etc.  For example, the &%Proposition that the cat is 
on the mat is represented here as a string of graphical characters displayed 
on a monitor and/or printed on paper, but it can be represented by a sequence 
of sounds or by some non-latin alphabet or by some cryptographic form")
