This is parser for KIF syntax and very limited XML syntax.  
The parsers are  described in the form of ANTLR rules.

The folder antlr-2.7.1 is ATNLR itself.
KIF.g is a parser description for KIF.
XML.g is a parser description for limited XML.

run 'make antlr' to install ANTLR
You need to install ANTLR (with help of 'make antlr') only once.

After that you can run 'make' to start ANTLR on grammar files.
As result you get a parser as executable file 'main'.
You may run 'main' with one argument - input file with KIF sentence
inside XML elements .

Run 'make clean' to delete all files created (including ANTLR installation).
Run 'make tidy' to delete files generated by ANTLR ( and files generated
from files generated by ANTLR).
That is 'make clean' is 'make tidy' + unstallion of ANTLR.
