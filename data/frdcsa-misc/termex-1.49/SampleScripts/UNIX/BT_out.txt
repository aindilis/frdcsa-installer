Let me describe  to you in perhaps the clearest  way possible the goal
of what I work on.

I realize that EVERY FAILED DEDUCTION LEADS TO FUTURE ACCIDENTS.

Let me describe an accident.  This is by no means pleasant.  So if the
accident  I am about  to describe  were avoidable,  it would  make the
world more pleasant.

This accident involves a young boy  being hit by a train.  I know that
what  I work  on would  be  capable of  preventing his  death and  the
consequent psychological suffering of all that knew him.

While  we cannot  protect one  hundred percent  of people  against one
hundred percent of  the hazards and vissicitudes of  life, we can make
relative improvements.  We  can in a formal sense  make 100% safety in
restricted systems, and  of course the goal is to  grow that safety to
larger  and  larger  systems.    It  is  exactly  the  consistency  of
computers, which don't  make them rigid thinkers, but  which make them
conditional and highly reliable system, that allows computers to solve
with  100% completeness  subclasses  of existing  problems.  That  is,
prevent whole categories of accidents.

The accident  involving the  boy follows a  template that I  have seen
multiple times  in videos of  accidents, and even  experienced myself.
In a  different video, the exact  same failure situation  leads to the
death of a gazelle.

This failure  situation is one that I  am aware now and  which to some
extent motivates unswerving commitment to the completion of my task.

Since it will be easier to describe the gazelle scenario, I will start
with that.  The typical feature is that it is two animals, two deer in
this case,  and a  threat which  is perceived by  one of  the animals,
which steps clear without thinking  to alert the other.  In this case,
the deer are  drinking from a water hole.  The  first deer is blocking
the view  of the second deer of  the water hole.  The  first deer sees
something approaching  at it (an alligator), and  quietly turns around
and leaves the water.  From the  point of view of the second dear, the
movement of  the first  deer conceals the  movement of  the alligator,
which proceeds to jump up and trap and kill the second deer.

I am  very offended by the  existence of such scenarios  in nature.  I
think they should be stopped.  I understand methods that would prevent
this and a great many other classes of accidents.

Now we will describe the death of the boy, which parallels closely the
death of the deer.  Two young  boys are walking towards a train track.
There is  a stationary train on  the track which  conceals an oncoming
train.  A  train horn is blowing,  and the boys fatally  presume it is
the stationary  train.  From the point  of view of the  camera, as the
boys near the  tracks we see that the second train  moving at about 80
MPH is the  real source of the horn sound.  The  boys are walking side
by side, let us call the first boy the boy who is closer to the train.
The first  boy blocks the view of  the second boy.  When  the train is
now within about  80 feet the first boy perceives it  and stops on the
very  edge of  track.  He  turns around  and steps  back automatically
(clearly is not thinking at  all about the second boy), barely missing
the train.  The second  boy is now about 4 feet in  front of the first
boy, and his head  may be seen to hesitate for about  a 6th of second,
an short moment of  psychological confusion before his hopelessly lost
position is  impacted by the  approaching train.  Needless to  say the
child's body is instantly  accelerated and rockets about three hundred
feet  in a  second actually  hitting the  cameraman at  a  velocity of
roughly 75 MPH.

This  death   may  have  been   prevented  as  a  matter   of  logical
completeness.  All that is needing is a facility to alert the child to
avoid  that position.   A  deduction was  necessary  which would  have
triggered a communication that the child should stop, we in advance of
the precipitious  accident.  I understand  how to implement  this, and
how to set up the correspondances between the mind and the system.

It is  in this spirit  that I pursue  the development of AI,  a system
which I know can prevent large classes of accidents.  It is sufficient
to prevent an accident to have  a proof that it will not happen.  Here
we  take proof  in  the formal  mathematical  sense.  By  establishing
correspondances between the physical  world and the simulated computer
world, simulation  occuring with knowledge based  systems, etc, (which
is more akin  to a very precise, somewhat  accurate human mental model
than to  say a simple  physics simulation), correspondences  that take
place through  input output devices  like mind to  machine interfaces,
cameras,  etc.,  we  will  be  able to  eliminate  large  ammounts  of
psychological  suffering   as  the   result  of  accidents   that  are
preventable by these systems.

To give a  simple account of a simple  implementation, suppose that we
have image  understanding routines.  <Show  video of VSAM>  The camera
agent, an IA (intelligent  agent) with image understanding intelligent
software, would be creating and  forwarding live information to an AI,
perhaps in the camera, perhaps  at a nearby station, across a wireless
adhoc  network, etc.   The information  would be  complex, but  in the
spirit of the existing technology,  would look about equal to a length
novel worth of statements of the following form.

(#$approaching #$OurPoorFriendForWhomWeGrieve #$railtrack-39423)
(#$approaching #$OurUnfortunateSurvivor #$railtrack-39423)
(#$emittingSound #$train-32488)

Of course, there would be  optimizations, etc, such as dialogs between
the camera and the IA.

Now, when  the camera reports  the approaching train (or  even before,
there might be a system  which is devoted to general purpose collision
avoidance, which has already contacted  the IA with information of the
approaching train), the IA makes the inference that there is 

(#$likelyEvent
	(#$and
		(#$dies OurPoorFriendForWhomWeGrieve)
		(#$collisionWith #$train-32488)))

I.E. It is  able to prove this.  <Show cyc  knowledge base>.  In which
case  the IA contacts  the agent  present with  the child.   The agent
advises  the child to  stop, 100  feet in  advance of  the approaching
train.  This child, if contacted in advance, would not have died.

Here  we have shown  how this  child's death  may have  been prevented
using existing technology.  Now, people might make the claim that this
is a pathological singular point and that in reality we cannot prevent
such things in  all cases.  Their argument is  overly general and, for
what?!   The fact is  that it  is both  obviously highly  important to
protect people from accidents, and it is also not a singular point, it
is the rigour and completeness  of the search procedures of logic that
make this  possible, and it does  not rely on  serendipity.  It cannot
prove everything, but it could have saved the lives of everyone I have
personally known who has died, and it can do much more than that.

I am  motivated on account of  the horrible experience  of the similar
way in which my beloved  sister died and an intuitive understanding of
the underlying  technology to pursue without  hesitation or disruption
the development of  this technology, and I sincerely  hope that people
will join me in this effort.  (Cruelly, she alone would have supported
my work  unconditionally.)  I  have obtained what  I feel is  the main
necessary result, that we may  consider for the purposes of our system
the world  as a large set of  problems, which need to  be decided, but
for any  program offered as a  solution, there are  always much larger
fragments  of the  problems that  are  not solvable  by that  program.
Therefore  I  believe  it  to  be  the case  that  by  collecting  and
distributing complex and intelligent software via the Debian GNU/Linux
system, we will be rapidly  reducing the number of unsolvable problems
of logic,  which when they remain  unsolved, are exactly  the cause of
every accident in the world and a majority of psychological suffering.
